Although we have done our best to avoid scams and to counter common misconceptions, there are still, as in 
complicated human annotation tasks unreliable annotations.
For instance, one common misconception is that some annotators in French were not aware that the word m****** 
was an insulting slur towards people with Down Syndrom rather than an origin. 
The same goes to people sometimes between wordings of nationality and gender/gender identity in Arabic.

We will publish more insights about the data, our annotation guidelines, and the dataset with emojis soon.
